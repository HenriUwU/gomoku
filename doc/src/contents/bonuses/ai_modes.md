# AI Modes

<br>

The aim of this bonus was to provide different modes for the AI: impossible, challenging, easy and crazy. For the first three modes, we simply change the depth of the algorithm. Respectively, 10 for the **Impossible** mode, 6 for the **Challenging** mode and 4 for the **Easy** mode. Finally, for the **Crazy** mode, the AI just does random moves.

<br>

You can change this mode in the **Parameters**.
